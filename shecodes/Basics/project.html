                <em>
                    HipHop is everywhere, and its presence is undeniable.
                </em></span>

            Today, it has positively impacted the socioeconomic status of communities of colour and has redefined the standard
            of
            fashion, perspectives, dance, and music of the people.
        
            <br /> <br />
            As Hiphop celebrates its 51st anniversary this coming August (2024), let us reflect on its cultural and historical
            significance
            to all of us today.
        
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            The roots of Hiphop ‚åõÔ∏è:
        </h3>
        
        <p class="body">
            Hiphop was born from a marginalised community as a force of self-expression. The culture formed its roots in the
            Bronx
            (New York), with its birthplace at <strong>1520 Sedgwick Avenue</strong>, where DJ Kool Herc (widely recognised as
            the father of HipHop)
            played music on his turntables and the community would come out to mingle and dance.
        
        <div class="koolherc">
            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/109/474/original/HipHop1973.jpg?1704525165"
                alt="koolherc" width="100%"/>
        </div>
        
        <br /> <br />
        
        Life in the Bronx back then (even today) was rough. Back in the 1970s, much of the white middle class moved to the
        suburbs to escape social and economic challenges. This migration shifted demographics and segregated communities like
        the Bronx, with a large demographic of African Americans living there. The community was neglected by mainstream
        institutions as businesses closed their doors, causing many economic opportunities and sources of entertainment to
        evaporate.¬†
        
        <br /> <br />
        
        As a result, urban youth turned to the streets for recreation and self-expression. The abandoned buildings and parking
        lots set the stage for block parties. These block parties laid the groundwork for everything associated with early hip
        hop culture.
        
        <br /> <br />
        
        <div class="conclusion">
            Hip Hop culture at its core, is therefore built on values of <span class="elements">social justice, peace, respect,
                self-worth, community, and having
                fun.</span> And it is because of these core values that Hip Hop is increasingly being used as a therapeutic tool
            when working
            with young people.</div>
